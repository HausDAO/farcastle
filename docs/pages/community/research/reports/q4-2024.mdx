# Challenges of Channel Owners

We interviewed channel owners and moderators from [/area51](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/area51), [/sad](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/sad), [/someone-build](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/someone-build), [/photography](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/photography), [magenta](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/magenta), [/coconuts](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/coconuts), [/cryptoleft](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/cryptoleft) and others in November and December of 2024.

The most pressing problem is onboarding members.

## Frustrations

> "getting people to discover the channel."

- Visibility
- Lack of Participation

## Insights

- Channels need visibility beyond existing members
- Channels struggle to maintain active participation
- Channels stagnate without somebody driving conversations forward
- There is a desire to combine tools into a common interface
- People are hearing about Farcastle in the [daos](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/daos) channel, from the [Octant](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/octant) accelerator, and via [Chones](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/chones).

## Vision

The future of channel DAOs lies in smaller, more functional groups that operate with greater autonomy, reducing reliance on central figures. A unified interface will integrate governance tools, providing a hub for AMAs, polls, and contests to foster engagement. Education is required to expand DAO adoption and ensure more communities harness the power of decentralized coordination.

## Opportunities

- Help provide visibility for channels
- Make it clear what the channel does and how to participate
- Identify ways to increase activity in channels

## Lessons Learned

- Coordinating interviews is difficult and the process is tiring
- Data from this round is limited and unstructured
- Analyzing data and identifying insights is time consuming

## Next Steps

- Segment interviews between owners, moderators, and members
- Get an understanding of current onboarding processes
- Ask about problems with participation
- Learn more about tools channel owners are using

# Overview

The Overview frame is similar to the DAO view in [DAOhaus Admin](https://admin.daohaus.club/). It shows the DAO name, description, and icon. These settings are updatable in DAOhaus Admin Settings. The Overview image displays the number of Proposals, Members, and Safes and the intents link to these views on DAOhaus Admin.

This frame can be casted from the "Cast Farcastle Frame" link or the Cast button in Settings. The URL may also be pasted into a new cast to display the frame.

## Active Proposals

When there are active proposals the Active Proposals intent on the Overview frame shows the count and links to the first active [Proposal](/frames/proposals) view.

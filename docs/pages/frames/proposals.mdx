# Proposals

The Active Proposals view provides an intent to Votes, view Details on DAOhaus Admin, see the Next active proposal, or return Home to the [Overview](/frames/overview) frame. If there are multiple active proposals this frame may also contain a Back intent that takes you to the previous proposal.

## View

You may also directly cast a proposal.

- Structure: `https://frames.farcastle.net/molochv3/:chainid/:daoid/proposals/:proposalid`
- Example: `https://frames.farcastle.net/molochv3/0xa/0x2a244bb4ccd4eb0897cf61e0c61963e1e1d161e3/proposals/9`

This frame can be casted from the Proposal Details view in DAOhaus Admin. The Cast button will dynamically generate the embed URL. The URL may also be pasted into a new cast to display the frame.

## Vote

The Votes intent on the Proposals frame allows members of the DAO to vote.

The vote view allows you to cast your vote for a proposal. It also contains intents for proposal Details that takes you to DAOhaus Admin and Back that returns to the Proposal frame.

Clicking the Yes or No intent fires off a transaction in the connected wallet.

When the transaction succeeds you will see "Tranaction Sent"

If you do not have voting tokens in the DAO, clicking the Yes or No intent fires off a transaction in the connected wallet that will fail.

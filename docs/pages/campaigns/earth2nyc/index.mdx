## What is your mission?

My mission is to spread the gospel of decentralized social coordination IRL at [/farcon-nyc](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/farcon-nyc). We have launched our [Fundraiser Mini App](https://warpcast.com/~/compose?text=&embeds[]=https://fundraiser.farcastle.net/) and it is time to show what it can do, onboard new believers, and connect with our internet frens in the flesh. Support the journey for @earth2travis to represent [/farcastle](https://warpcast.com/~/channel/farcastle) and pay off his  mom's credit card.

All funds will be used for flights and hotels. Food is optional. I will pay for the beer and nicotine.

## What do contributors receive?

Contributors receive $EARTH token—a symbol of belief in our mission and my ongoing ability to survive capitalism whilst working in open-source. Token holders get a big hug in New York City and we will make FarCon stories together.

## Disclaimer

I really hate to ask because this is not what we want this app to be about. This campaign is to demonstrate what communities can do when they come together to support a cause and each other. When we reach our goal it will mark an amazing moment in Farcaster lore. We appreciate you being a part of our story.

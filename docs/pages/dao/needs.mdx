## Secure Grants

Securing grants emerges as the lifeblood of our ambitious endeavor. Without the treasures of funding, our vision slips into the abyss. We must traverse the realms, seeking grants that will empower our quest, ensuring that our tools are forged and banners raised high.

## Onboard Communities

Onboarding communities stands as a sacred rite for our mission's success. By forging bonds with channel owners and moderators, we unlock the secrets of their aspirations and tribulations. This knowledge guides us in crafting tailored solutions, empowering each community to flourish as they wield the tools of Farcastle.

## Establish Partnerships

Establishing partnerships weaves a tapestry of alliances that bolster our efforts. We seek tools that enhance the prowess of channel DAOs, testing innovations and welcoming souls into our fold. These collaborations amplify our influence, spreading the word of our technology throughout their domains. We seek those whose vision aligns with prioritizing creativity over DAO tooling.

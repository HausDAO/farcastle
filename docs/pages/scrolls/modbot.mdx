# [ModBot](https://modbot.sh/)

Enchanted automaton designed to moderate and manage content in channels. ModBot helps maintain community standards while allowing caretakers to focus on engagement and interactions. It stands as a vigilant sentinel, ever watchful over the sanctity of communities.

ModBot provides a customizable frame that can be cast in your channel where potential members can view membership criteria and request to join the channel. When a potential member taps or clicks 'Join Now' the ModBot server checks the user token balance and sends an invite if they qualify.
